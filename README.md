# COâ‚‚ Emission Prediction System

A machine learning-based web application that predicts **vehicle COâ‚‚ emissions** based on engine size, fuel type, and other vehicle specifications.  
This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a predictive ML model â€” from **data preprocessing** and **model training** to **deployment on Render** with interactive visualization.

---

#Overview

With increasing concern over environmental impact, accurate prediction of COâ‚‚ emissions is essential for vehicle manufacturers and environmental researchers.  
This system uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model to estimate COâ‚‚ emissions from automotive datasets and provides insights into key contributing factors.

# Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Deployment:** [Render](https://render.com/)  
- **Visualization:** PowerBI Dashboard (for data insights)

---

# Features

- Data preprocessing using **OneHotEncoder** and feature scaling  
- Trained and evaluated **Random Forest Regressor** for high prediction accuracy  
- Visualized relationships between engine parameters and emissions using PowerBI  
- Web application interface deployed on **Render** for real-time predictions  
- Low-latency API endpoint for user inputs and model inference

#  Dataset

- Dataset Source: Publicly available automotive COâ‚‚ emission dataset  
- Key Attributes:
  - Engine Size  
  - Cylinders  
  - Fuel Type  
  - Fuel Consumption (City / Highway / Combined)  
  - COâ‚‚ Emissions (Target Variable)
